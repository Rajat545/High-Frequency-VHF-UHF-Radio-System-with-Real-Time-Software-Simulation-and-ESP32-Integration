# High-Frequency-VHF-UHF-Radio-System-with-Real-Time-Software-Simulation-and-ESP32-Integration
Developed a small-scale VHF/UHF radio communication system using RF modules (433 MHz/2.4 GHz), Arduino, and ESP32. Integrated real-time software diagnostics for fault detection, signal monitoring, and remote access, enhancing system reliability and enabling efficient troubleshooting through live data and simulation.
